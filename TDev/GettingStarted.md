# Messaging Getting Started
## Introduction
The Messaging API provides the ability to send SMS messages to any mobile device.
The first step to use the Telstra Messaging API is to create a developer account and apply for a new API key by registering your application on the portal.
There is a limit of 1000 free SMS messages per month and 100 per day. If you would like more volume then contact us at [t.dev@team.telstra.com](t.dev@team.telstra.com)
## Authentication
To get an OAuth 2.0 Authentication token, pass through your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret that you received when you registered for the Messages API key. The `grant_type` should be left as `client_credentials` and the scope as `NSMS`. The token will expire in one hour.
```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Obtain these keys from the Telstra Developer Portal
CONSUMER_KEY="your consumer key"
CONSUMER_SECRET="your consumer secret"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=$CONSUMER_KEY&client_secret=CONSUMER_SECRET&scope=NSMS' \
  'https://sapi.telstra.com/v1/oauth/token'
```
### Response
```json
{
  "expires_in" : "35999",
  "access_token" : "1234567890123456788901234567"
}
```
## Sending a message
It is possible to send a message with a simple post to https://sapi.telstra.com/v2/messages/SMS as demonstrated below
```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Use the Messaging API to send an SMS
AccessToken="Consumers Access Token"
Dest="Destination number"
curl -X post -H "Authorization: Bearer $AccessToken" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "to":"$Dest", "body":"Test Message" }' \
  https://sapi.telstra.com/v2/messages/sms/
```
A number of parameters can be used in this call, these are;
| Parameter | Description |
| - | - |
| `to` | The number that the message should be sent to. This is a mobile number in international format. eg:+61412345678 |
| `validity` | Normally if the message cannot be delivered immediatly, it will be stored and delivery will be periodically reattempted. The newtork will keep reatempting the message for upto seven days. <br/>It is possible to select a small period than 7 days by specifying including this parrameter and specifing the number of minutes that delivery should be attempted. eg: including `"validity": 60` will specify that if a message can't be delivered within the first 60 minutes them the network should stop. |
| `scheduledDelivery` | This parrameter will instruct the newtork to store the message and start attempting to deliver it after the specified number of minutes: <br/>e.g.: If `"scheduledDelivery": 120` is included, then the newtork will not attempt to start message delivery for two hours after the message has been submitted. |
| `priority` | When messages are queued up for a number, then it is possible to set where a new message will be placed in the queue. If the priority is set to true then the new message will be placed ahead of all messages with a normal priority. <br/>If there are no messages queued for the number, then this parrameter has no effect. |
| `notifyURL` | It is possible for the network to make a call to a URL when the message has been delivered (or has expired), different URLs can be set per message. <br/>Please refer to the Delivery notification section below. |
| `body` | This field contains the message text, this can be up to 500 UTF-8 characters. As mobile devices rarely support the full range of UTF-8 characters, it is possible that some characters may not be translated correctly by the mobile device. |
### Response
A typical response will look like;
```json
[
  {
    "to": "+61418123456",
    "deliveryStatus": "MessageWaiting",
    "messageId": "/cccb1ce100035ebd000000000c4017eb019e0301/1261418404783"
  }
]
```
The fields mean;
| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| `to` | Just a copy of the number the message is sent to. |
| `deliveryStatus` | Gives and indication of if the message has been accepted for delivery. The description field contains information on why a message may have been rejected. |
| `description` | Description of why a message was rejected. |
| `messageId` | For an accepted message, ths will be a refernce that can be used to check the messages status. <br/>Please refer to the Delivery notification section below. |
## Delivery Notification
The API provides several methods for notifying when a message has been delivered to the destination.
When the API is added to the application there is an opportunity to specify a notification URL, when the message has been delivered the API will make a call to this URL to advise of the message status.
Alternatively, a notification URL may be specified per message which will override the API setting for the single message only.
Also if it isn't possible to set a notify URL, then the API allows a call that can be used to poll for the message status.
Please note that the notification URLs and the polling call are exclusive. If a notification URL has been set then the polling call will not provide any useful information.
### Notification URL format
When a message has reached its final state, the API will send a POST to the URL that has been previously specified. The call will look like this;
```json
{
  "to":"+61418123456",
  "sentTimestamp":"2017-03-17T10:05:22+10:00",
  "receivedTimestamp":"2017-03-17T10:05:23+10:00",
  "messageId":"\/cccb284200035236000000000ee9d074019e0301\/1261418123456",
  "deliveryStatus":"DELIVRD"
}
```
The fields are;
| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| `to` | The number the message was sent to |
| `receivedTimestamp` | Time the message was sent to the API |
| `sentTimestamp` | Time handling of the message ended |
| `deliveryStatus` | The final state of the message |
| `messageId` | The same reference that was returned when the original message was sent. |
Upon receiving this call it is expected that your servers will give a 204 (No Content) response. Anything else will cause the API to reattempt the call 5 minutes later.
## Polling for Message Status
If no notification URL has been specified, it is possible to poll for the message status, an example of this and explanation of the parameters are given below.
```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Example of how to poll for a message status
AccessToken="Consumer Access Token"
MessageId="Previous supplied Message Id, URL encoded"
curl -X get -H "Authorization: Bearer $AccessToken" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://sapi.telstra.com/v2/messages/sms/$MessageId"
```
Note, the `MessageId` that appears in the URL must be URL encoded, just copying the message id as it was supplied when submitting the message won't work.
### Response
The response will be something like;
```json
{
  "to": "+61418123456",
  "sentTimestamp": "2017-03-17T09:16:49+10:00",
  "receivedTimestamp": "2017-03-17T09:16:50+10:00",
  "deliveryStatus": "DELIVRD",
}
```
The field meanings are;
| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| `to` | The number the message was sent to |
| `receivedTimestamp` | Time the message was sent to the API |
| `sentTimestamp` | Time handling of the message ended |
| `deliveryStatus` | The final state of the message |
